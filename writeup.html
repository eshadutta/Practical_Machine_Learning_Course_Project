**Background**

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, I will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This information is encrypted in the "classe" variable in the training set. The following sections explain how I built the model, how I used cross validation, what the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the these choices. 

This prediction model is further used to predict 20 different test cases.

I hereby present a write-up document for the peer graded assignment for the Practical Machine Learning course hosted on Coursera.

**DATA**

The training data for this project are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

**Step 1: Data Extraction and Preliminary cleanup**

To begin with, we first download the data and store in our machine using the steps below:

```Code Snippet```
> url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
> download.file(url, destfile = "training.csv")
> training <- read.csv("training.csv")

Let us take a look at the training data set to understand its various components and the corresponding values:
